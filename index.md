My section is "Learning and Using Causal Knowledge for Advancing AI and Scientific Discovery" with Biwei Huang and Jelena Bradic

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic we covered had to do with using causal discovery to find different types of variables that might effect what an online shopper buys. I am very interested in consumer decision making and how to discover data points that might not have been though of before.
**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I would like to ivestigate how someones activity on the internet will determine whether or not they are a good person to targer with advertising. This is different that determining who is most likely to want a product. Rather it is determining who is most likely to be swayed into making a purchase depending on advertisements.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
I would change my approach by using more data points that might not seem super important but might be. Using causal discovery I should be able to weed out a couple data points that might be more important than previously thought.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would be interesting in applying data points such as user clicks and user search history to profile certain people depending on what products they might be interested in. This would require such data which is the challenging part.
